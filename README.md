Some school projects I've done. I'm currently revising them.

# Project 1
This project involves the multiplication of all values in a line in matrix A by the sum of all the values in a column in matrix B.

It involves some other things too, like searching for a value in an array, calculating an euler number up to n terms, and ordering values, both in matrices and arrays.
