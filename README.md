# school-projects
Some school projects I've done. I'm currently revising them.

# Project 1
This project involves the multiplication of all values in a line in matrix A by the sum of all the values in a column in matrix B.

It involves some other things too, like searching for a value in an array, calculating an euler number up to n terms, and ordering values, both in matrices and arrays.

# Hex-To-Binary
This is a program that asks you for a hexadecimal number of up to 6 digits, then it shows the decimal and binary value of that number.

# Project 2
This project allows the user to define an array size, order the values of the array in 3 different methods, and also search for them in 2 different ways.

The values in the array are randomly generated, and the time taken to sort them is displayed.
